# Assistance Required: Prisma Generate Path Issue

**Task:** 2.1 - Implement Content Workflow Status in Schema  
**Issue:** Unable to run `npx prisma generate` due to path resolution problems between WSL and Windows environments.

## Details:
- Schema file exists at `/home/user/projects/nexus/prisma/schema.prisma`
- Command execution fails with UNC path errors and incorrect path resolution
- Attempted solutions:
  - Relative paths (`../../../../prisma/schema.prisma`)
  - Absolute WSL path (`/home/user/projects/nexus/prisma/schema.prisma`)

## Required Action:
Please run the following command manually in the correct environment:
```bash
cd /home/user/projects/nexus && npx prisma generate
