## Original Problem:
The original problem was to implement a comprehensive test suite for the project, starting with unit tests for core components. The current task was to create unit tests for the `Button` component.

## Failed Fix Attempt:
The failed fix attempt involved creating a unit test file for the `Button` component and attempting to fix the errors that arose during the test execution. The errors included issues with importing testing libraries and incorrect usage of testing functions. I attempted to fix these errors by modifying the test file, but I was unable to resolve the issues and reached the tool call repetition limit.

## New Error:
The new error was the tool call repetition limit being reached for both `apply_diff` and `write_to_file`, indicating a failure to resolve the underlying issues with the test setup.
