# Architectural Review Request: Test Configuration Issues

## Original Problem
From NEEDS_ASSISTANCE.md:
- Test setup conflicts between Playwright and Vitest
- Jest/Vitest compatibility issues
- Path resolution errors for component imports
- Mixed testing frameworks causing configuration conflicts

## Failed Fix Attempt
From FIX_PLAN.md:
1. Separate test types in configuration
2. Configure Playwright separately
3. Migrate Jest tests to Vitest
4. Update NPM scripts
5. Clean up and reset

## New Errors
- Vitest still processing e2e tests despite exclude pattern
- ReferenceError: jest is not defined in integration tests
- Component import errors due to path resolution
- Syntax errors in test files
