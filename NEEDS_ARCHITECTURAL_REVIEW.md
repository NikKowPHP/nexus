# Architectural Review Needed: Deployment Failure After Dependency Fix

## Original Problem
The initial issue was a dependency conflict between `@visx/zoom@3.12.0` requiring React 16-18 and our project using React 19.1.0, which broke Stripe integration.

## Failed Fix Attempt
The FIX_PLAN.md approach was to:
1. Downgrade React to 18.3.1
2. Ensure Stripe compatibility with `@stripe/react-stripe-js@3.7.0`
3. Perform clean install and testing
4. Deploy to production

While local builds and tests succeeded, the production deployment failed during `npm install`.

## New Error
```
Error: Command "npm install" exited with 1
```
