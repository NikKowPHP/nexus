# Todo List for Nexus AI Architect & Development Agent

**Objective:** To generate all necessary Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) documents for Project Nexus.

**Source of Truth:** All documents listed below **must** be derived from the information and specifications detailed in the **`Master Product & Business Specification` (Version 1.0)**. Use this master document as your single source of context and requirements to ensure perfect alignment across the entire project.

## Phase 1: Project Scoping & Requirements Analysis

- [ ] **1.1. Software Requirements Specification (SRS)**
    - **File:** `docs/requirements/Software_Requirements_Specification.md`
    - **Description:** Create a detailed document that formalizes all functional and non-functional requirements. This includes elaborating on each feature from Section 5.0 of the master spec (e.g., AI Assessment Engine, Gamification), defining user roles (Free User, Premium User, Admin, Expert), and specifying performance, security, and privacy requirements from Section 8.0.

- [ ] **1.2. Use Case & User Story Documentation**
    - **File:** `docs/requirements/User_Stories_and_Use_Cases.md`
    - **Description:** Based on Section 4.0 ("Target Audience & User Journey"), generate detailed user stories for the MVP. Use the format: "As a [user type], I want to [action] so that [benefit]." Create use case diagrams for key user flows, such as "User Completes a Node," "User Upgrades to Pro," and "AI Provides Assessment Feedback."

## Phase 2: System Design & Architecture

- [ ] **2.1. System Architecture Design Document**
    - **File:** `docs/architecture/System_Architecture_Design.md`
    - **Description:** Based on Section 8.0 ("Technical Strategy & Architecture"), create a comprehensive architecture document. This must include:
        - A high-level diagram illustrating the microservices architecture (User Service, Content Service, AI Service, etc.).
        - A description of the communication protocols between services (e.g., REST APIs, gRPC, message queues).
        - Justification for the proposed technology stack (React, Node.js, databases).

- [ ] **2.2. API Specification**
    - **File:** `docs/architecture/API_Specification_v1.yaml`
    - **Description:** Generate a formal OpenAPI (Swagger) specification for the RESTful APIs that will connect the frontend to the backend microservices. Detail the endpoints, request/response payloads, and authentication methods (e.g., JWT). Key endpoints will include user authentication, roadmap data retrieval, and assessment submission.

- [ ] **2.3. Database Schema Design**
    - **File:** `docs/architecture/Database_Schema.md`
    - **Description:** Create the logical and physical database schema.
        - **SQL Schema:** Design tables for Users, Subscriptions, Achievements, etc. Include relationships and constraints.
        - **NoSQL Schema:** Design the document structure for `Roadmaps` and `Nodes`, accommodating flexible, nested content.

- [ ] **2.4. AI Integration Architecture**
    - **File:** `docs/architecture/AI_Integration_Architecture.md`
    - **Description:** Detail the specific architecture for the "AI as a Coach" feature. Diagram how a user submission (e.g., audio file) is processed: which service handles the upload, how it calls the external LLM API, how the feedback is parsed from the LLM's response, and how it is stored and delivered back to the user.

## Phase 3: Development & Implementation Plan

- [ ] **3.1. MVP Feature & Task Breakdown**
    - **File:** `project_management/MVP_Task_Breakdown.md`
    - **Description:** Convert the MVP features listed in Section 9.1 of the master spec into a detailed list of programmable tasks (e.g., "Implement user registration endpoint," "Build React component for node view," "Set up Streak counter logic"). This document will be used to populate a project management tool like Jira or Trello.

- [ ] **3.2. CI/CD Pipeline Design**
    - **File:** `docs/devops/CI_CD_Pipeline.md`
    - **Description:** Document the plan for the Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment pipeline. Specify the tools (e.g., GitHub Actions, Jenkins), the stages (Build, Test, Deploy), and the branching strategy (e.g., GitFlow) that will be used.

## Phase 4: Testing & Quality Assurance

- [ ] **4.1. Master Test Plan**
    - **File:** `docs/qa/Master_Test_Plan.md`
    - **Description:** Create a comprehensive test plan for the MVP. This should include:
        - **Unit Testing Strategy:** Define the scope and required coverage for backend services and frontend components.
        - **Integration Testing Strategy:** Plan for testing the interactions between microservices.
        - **End-to-End (E2E) Testing Strategy:** Outline test cases for key user flows, like the full user journey described in Section 4.0.
        - **Performance & Load Testing Strategy:** Define how you will test system performance against expected user load.

## Phase 5: Deployment & Operations

- [ ] **5.1. Infrastructure & Deployment Plan**
    - **File:** `docs/devops/Infrastructure_and_Deployment_Plan.md`
    - **Description:** Detail the cloud infrastructure (e.g., on AWS, GCP, or Azure). Specify which services will be used (e.g., Kubernetes for container orchestration, S3 for storage, RDS for the database). Document the step-by-step deployment process for both the initial launch and subsequent updates.

## Phase 6: User-Facing Documentation

- [ ] **6.1. User Guide / Knowledge Base Outline**
    - **File:** `docs/user/User_Guide_Outline.md`
    - **Description:** Create a structured outline for the help center/knowledge base. The topics should cover "Getting Started," "How the AI Coach Works," "Managing Your Subscription," and other key areas to help users understand and use the platform effectively.
