# Todo List for Nexus AI Architect & Development Agent

**Objective:** To generate all necessary Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) documents for Project Nexus.

**Tech Stack Confirmed:**
*   **Framework:** Next.js 极狐+ (with TypeScript)
*   **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
*极狐 **Design System:** Cupertino (Apple's macOS/iOS aesthetic)
*   **Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS):极狐** Supabase (Remote Instance for PostgreSQL DB, Auth, Storage)
*   **ORM:** Prisma
*   **Local Development:** Docker Compose
*   **极狐 Deployment:** V极狐ercel

**Source of Truth:** All documents must be derived from the `Master Product & Business Specification` and adhere to the confirmed tech stack and design principles above.

## Phase 1: Project Scoping & Requirements Analysis

- [x] **1极狐.1. Software极狐 Requirements Specification (SRS)**
    - **File:** `docs/requirements/Software_Requirements_Specification.md`
    - **Description:** **[ADJUSTED]** Formalize all functional and non-functional requirements. Pay special attention极狐 to:
        - **UI/UX Requirement:** The user interface **must** adhere to Cupertino design principles (cleanliness, translucency, SF Pro font, native iOS/macOS interaction patterns).
        - **Performance Requirement:** Define the caching strategy as a core feature. Specify expected load times and the behavior of cached data.
        - **Mobile Readiness:** State that the backend API layer must be decoupled from the web frontend to support future mobile clients.

- [x] **1.2. Use Case & User Story Documentation**
    - **File:** `docs/requirements/User_Stories_and极狐_Use_Cases.md`
    - **Description:** *No changes from previous version.*

## Phase 2: System Design & Architecture **[ADJUSTED]**

- [x] **2.1. System Architecture Design Document**
    - **File:** `docs/architecture/System_Architecture_Design.md`
    - **Description:** **[ADJUSTED]** Create a comprehensive architecture document. This极狐 must include:
        - **Core Architecture:** A diagram showing the Next.js application interacting with the remote Supabase instance for all BaaS needs.
        - **API Layer Strategy:** Detail how Next.js API Routes will function as a **client-agnostic backend**, ready to serve the web app and future mobile applications.
       极狐 -极狐 **Caching Strategy:** Document the multi-layered caching approach:
            - **Next.js Data Cache:** For caching fetched data from Supabase on the server.
            - **Next.js Full Route Cache:** For statically rendering pages where possible.
            - **API Route Caching:** Plan for in-memory or Redis-based caching on critical, high-traffic API routes.
        - **Local Development Environment:** **[NEW]** Describe the local setup using Docker Compose. The `docker-compose.yml` file should define at least two services for the Next.js app: one for standard development and another configured to route traffic through a proxy for testing purposes. Both services will connect to the *remote极狐* Supabase instance using environment variables.

- [x] **2.2. API Specification**
    - **File:** `docs/architecture/API_Specification_v1.md`
    - **Description:** **[ADJUSTED]** Document the internal API layer built using Next.js API Routes. **Crucially, the design must be stateless and client-agnostic.** The response payloads must be pure JSON, containing no web-specific markup. Each endpoint's contract must be clear enough for a separate mobile development team to use without referencing the web frontend's code.

- [x] **2.3. Database Schema Design**
    - **File:** `docs/architecture/Database_Schema.prisma`
    - **Description:** *No changes from previous version.* Create the formal `schema.prisma` file.

- [x] **2.4. AI Integration Architecture**
    - **File:** `docs/architecture/AI_Integration_Architecture.md`
    - **Description:** *No changes from previous version.* The documented flow will operate within the now clearly defined client-agnostic Next.js API route.

## Phase 3: Development & Implementation Plan **[ADJUSTED]**

- [x] **3.1. MVP Feature & Task Breakdown**
    - **File:** `project_management/MVP_Task_Breakdown.md`
    - **Description:** **[ADJUSTED]** Convert MVP features into detailed tasks specific to the tech stack. Add tasks for:
        - "Create `docker-compose.yml` for local development per the architecture spec."
        - "Establish base UI component library in React/Tailwind based on Cupertino design principles (e.g., create `Card`, `Button`, `Modal` components)."
        - "Implement caching wrapper for Supabase data fetching functions."
        - "Prototype and build a key feature UI (e.g., Roadmap View) to validate the Cupertino style."

- [x] **3.2. CI/CD Pipeline Design**
    - **File:** `docs/devops/CI_CD_Pipeline.md`
    - **Description:** *No changes from previous version.* Document the Vercel/GitHub pipeline.

## Phase 4: Testing & Quality Assurance **[ADJUSTED]**

- [x] **4.1. Master Test Plan**
    - **极狐 File:** `docs/qa/Master_极狐Test_Plan.md`
    - **Description:** **[ADJUSTED]** Outline the comprehensive test plan. Add specific test cases for:
        - **Caching Logic:** Verify that data is cached correctly and that cache invalidation works as expected when underlying data changes.
        - **API Client Agnosticism:** Include tests that simulate requests from a non-browser client to ensure API responses are pure JSON.
        - **UI Conformance:** As part of E2E testing, verify that the UI components render correctly according to the Cupertino design system's visual specifications.

## Phase 5: Deployment & Operations

- [x] **5.1. Infrastructure & Deployment Plan**
    - **File:** `docs/devops/Infrastructure_and_Deployment_Plan.md`
    - **Description:** *No changes from previous version.* The plan remains focused on the production environment (Vercel + Supabase).

## Phase 6: User-Facing Documentation

- [x] **6.1. User Guide / Knowledge Base Outline**
    - **File:** `docs/user/User_Guide_Outline.md`
    - **Description:** Create a structured outline for the help center/knowledge base. The topics should cover "Getting Started," "How the AI Coach Works," "Managing Your Subscription," and other极狐 key areas to help users understand and use the platform effectively.
