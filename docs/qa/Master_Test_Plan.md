# Master Test Plan for Project Nexus  
**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** June 9, 2025  

## 1. Introduction  
This document outlines the comprehensive testing strategy for Project Nexus, covering functional and non-functional requirements derived from the [Software Requirements Specification](docs/requirements/Software_Requirements_Specification.md).

## 2. Testing Objectives  
- Validate functional requirements implementation  
- Ensure system reliability under load  
- Verify UI consistency with Cupertino design system  
- Confirm caching behavior meets performance requirements  
- Guarantee API client-agnosticism  

## 3. Test Types & Scope  
| Test Type | Tools | Coverage |  
|-----------|-------|----------|  
| Unit Testing | Jest, React Testing Library | Core logic, utilities |  
| Integration Testing | Cypress | Component interactions |  
| E2E Testing | Cypress | User workflows |  
| Performance Testing | Lighthouse, k6 | Caching, response times |  
| API Testing | Postman, Newman | Client-agnostic contracts |  
| UI Conformance | Percy, Applitools | Visual consistency |  

## 4. Key Test Cases  
### 4.1 Caching Logic Verification  
```gherkin
Feature: Data Caching
  Scenario: Cache population on data fetch
    Given a user requests roadmap data
    When the data is fetched from Supabase
    Then it should be cached in Redis
    And subsequent requests should return cached data

  Scenario: Cache invalidation on data update
    Given cached roadmap data exists
    When the roadmap is updated by an admin
    Then the cache should be invalidated
    And the next request should fetch fresh data
```

### 4.2 API Client Agnosticism  
```gherkin
Feature: API Client Independence
  Scenario: Mobile client API consumption
    Given a mobile client application
    When it calls the /api/roadmaps endpoint
    Then it should receive pure JSON response
    And the response should contain no HTML/CSS markup

  Scenario: Web client API consumption
    Given the web client application
    When it calls the /api/roadmaps endpoint
    Then it should receive the same JSON structure
    As received by the mobile client
```

### 4.3 UI Conformance  
```gherkin
Feature: Cupertino Design Compliance
  Scenario: Component rendering validation
    Given a Button component
    When rendered in light mode
    Then it should match Cupertino design specs:
      - SF Pro font
      - 14pt font size
      - 10px corner radius
      - Proper press animation

  Scenario: Dark mode compatibility
    Given the app in dark mode
    When viewing any screen
    Then all components should:
      - Use system-defined dark colors
      - Maintain proper contrast ratios
      - Preserve translucency effects
```

## 5. Test Environment  
- **Local:** Docker Compose setup (Next.js + Redis)  
- **Staging:** Vercel Preview Deployment  
- **Production:** Monitor-only with synthetic checks  

## 6. Exit Criteria  
- 95% code coverage (unit tests)  
- 0 critical/open P1 bugs  
- All acceptance criteria met  
- Performance benchmarks achieved  
- UX approval on visual consistency
