# Fix Plan: Missing Architecture Map

## Issue
The required architecture map file `docs/architecture_map.md` was missing, blocking development.

## Resolution
1. Surveyor AI generated the architecture map by analyzing the codebase and task files.
2. Mapped all existing features to their implementation files.
3. Verified the architecture map is now present and accurate.

## Next Steps
- Dispatcher will resume normal development workflow.
- Developers can now reference the architecture map for implementation guidance.
