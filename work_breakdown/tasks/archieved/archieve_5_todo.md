# Final Blueprint Polish: The "Last Mile" Todo List

**Objective:** To eliminate the final points of ambiguity in the architectural documents, making the plan 100% prescriptive and ready for LLM-driven implementation.

---

- [x] **1. [UI/UX] Make the Design System Prescriptive**
    - **Action:** Edit the `docs/architecture/Design_System_Specification.md` file.
    - **Details:** Add a new section titled **"4. Tailwind CSS Configuration"**. In this section, provide the exact code block that should be placed in the `tailwind.config.js` file to implement the defined design tokens.
    - **Example Code Block to Add:**
      ```javascript
      // Example for docs/architecture/Design_System_Specification.md Section 4
      module.exports = {
        theme: {
          extend: {
            colors: {
              primary: '#007bff',
              secondary: '#6c757d',
              accent: '#ff6b6b',
              background: '#f8f9fa',
              'text-primary': '#212529',
              'text-secondary': '#495057',
            },
            fontFamily: {
              sans: ['Inter', 'sans-serif'],
            },
          },
        },
        plugins: [],
      }
      ```

- [x] **2. [UI/UX] Specify the Interactive Roadmap Visualization**
    - **Action:** Edit the `docs/architecture/Design_System_Specification.md` file.
    - **Details:** Add a new section titled **"5. Complex Component Specs: Interactive Roadmap"**. This section must define:
        - **Node States (Visuals):** Describe the appearance for each state: `locked` (e.g., grayed out, small), `unlocked` (e.g., primary color, normal size), `active` (e.g., glowing border, larger size), `completed` (e.g., checkmark icon, muted primary color).
        - **Edge States (Lines):** Describe the appearance of the connecting lines: `default` (e.g., light gray), `path-to-active` (e.g., primary color).
        - **Interaction Behavior:** Define what happens on: `hover` (show tooltip with node title), `click` (navigate to node page), `zoom/pan` (smooth transitions).

- [x] **3. [Project Management] Final Plan Lock**
    - **Action:** Archive the current `todo.md`. Create a new, final `todo.md` that simply states: **"The project blueprint is complete. Proceed with the high-level `documentation/0_to_prod_roadmap.md` and its corresponding granular task lists."**
    - **Outcome:** This signifies the end of the planning phase and the official start of the implementation phase.

### **Conclusion: Ready to Build**

Once this final, short refinement is complete, you will have done something remarkable. You will have created one of the most comprehensive, well-structured, and AI-ready project blueprints possible.

Every potential point of ambiguity has been systematically identified and eliminated. The path from `git init` to a deployed, monetized, production application is clear.

**The blueprint is complete. You are ready to build.**
