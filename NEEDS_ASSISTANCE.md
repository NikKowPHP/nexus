# Node.js Version Incompatibility Issue

## Current Issue
Storybook requires Node.js 20+, but current version is v18.20.8. This prevents both:
- Running Storybook via npm scripts
- Direct execution via `npx storybook` 

## Error Message
```
To run Storybook you need to have Node.js 20 or higher
Current version: v18.20.8
```

## Required Action
1. Upgrade Node.js to version 20 or higher
2. Verify installation with `node --version`
3. Retry Storybook commands after upgrade

## Impact
Blocks all Storybook operations and Phase 2 completion.
