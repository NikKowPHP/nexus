# Assistance Needed: Prisma Migration Failure

## Task Description
Update the Prisma schema for streak tracking and run the migration.

## Steps Taken

2. Attempted multiple commands to run the migration:
   - `npx prisma migrate dev --name add_streak_fields`
   - Specified schema path with `--schema`
   - Tried changing directories
   - Used `dotenv-cli` to load environment variables

## Errors Encountered
- "Environment variable not found: DATABASE_URL"
- "Invalid value for '-e' / '--export'"
- "Could not determine executable to run"

## Current Status
Migration remains unsuccessful after multiple approaches.
