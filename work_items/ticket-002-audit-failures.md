**To:** Planner AI
**From:** Auditor AI
**Date:** 2025-06-26
**Reference Audit:** The most recent verification pass after the Prisma schema was corrected.

## 1. Objective
The previous audit confirmed that critical data layer and authentication issues have been resolved. However, several high-priority implementation gaps and documentation inaccuracies remain. This work item directs the Planner to create granular task lists to address these final outstanding issues.

---

## 2. Required Planning Actions

Please create or update the `work_breakdown/tasks/` with new, atomic task lists to address the following discrepancies:

### **Action Item 1: Implement Critical API Input Validation**

*   **Problem:** The API routes for creating and updating `Nodes` and `Roadmaps` do not validate the incoming `req.body`. This is a significant security and data integrity risk.
*   **Affected Files:**
    *   `project-nexus/apps/web/pages/api/admin/nodes/[...].ts`
    *   `project-nexus/apps/web/pages/api/admin/roadmaps/[...].ts`
*   **Required Plan:** Create a new task list for implementing server-side validation (e.g., using Zod) for the `POST` and `PUT` request bodies in the specified API routes.

### **Action Item 2: Complete AI Assessment Feedback UI**

*   **Problem:** The `AssessmentSubmission.tsx` component successfully handles file/text submission but does not render the resulting AI feedback. The UI for displaying strengths, weaknesses, and suggestions contains only placeholder comments.
*   **Affected File:** `project-nexus/apps/web/src/components/AssessmentSubmission.tsx`
*   **Required Plan:** Create a new task list to build the UI components and logic required to receive and render the AI feedback within the `AssessmentSubmission` component.

### **Action Item 3: Correct Documentation Inaccuracies**

*   **Problem:** The project's task-tracking documentation is out of sync with the codebase reality.
*   **Affected File:** `work_breakdown/tasks/4.3_security_hardening.md`
*   **Required Plan:** Create a single task to update this file. The task `[x] Task 3: Add Input Validation to API Endpoints` must be changed to incomplete: `[ ] Task 3: Add Input Validation to API Endpoints`.
